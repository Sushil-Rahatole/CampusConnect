# CampusConnect 🌐

CampusConnect is a social media platform built exclusively for engineering students to bridge the gap between Tier 1 and Tier 4 colleges. It creates a unified digital space where students can connect, share, collaborate, and innovate together.

## 🚀 Vision

Innovation is not limited to Tier 1 institutions. Talent, creativity, and ideas exist everywhere, but many Tier 4 colleges lack an ecosystem that nurtures innovation. CampusConnect aims to bridge this gap by providing a collaborative platform that enables equal exposure, learning, and growth for all engineering students.

## ✨ Features

- 📢 Share daily academic and personal journey updates  
- 💡 Showcase projects, ideas, and innovations  
- 🤝 Connect students across colleges and tiers  
- 🧠 Knowledge sharing and peer learning  
- 📚 Document learning paths and career journeys  
- 🌱 Foster an inclusive innovation-driven ecosystem  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React / HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Authentication:** JWT 
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

## 🎯 Target Users

- Engineering students from Tier 1 to Tier 4 colleges  
- Students looking for collaboration, exposure, and mentorship  
- Innovators who believe talent is not defined by college tier  

## 📌 Problem Statement

Tier 4 colleges often lack the environment and exposure required to foster innovation. This platform addresses that challenge by connecting students across institutions, enabling collaboration, and providing visibility to ideas and projects regardless of college background.

## 🌍 Impact

By connecting students from IITs and other Tier 1 colleges with students from Tier 3 and Tier 4 colleges, CampusConnect encourages diverse perspectives, meaningful collaboration, and innovation driven by inclusivity.
